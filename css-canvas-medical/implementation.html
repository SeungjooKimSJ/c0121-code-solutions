      <p>
       Becoming a physician will endure as your all-time best investment
       decision, and on behalf of your community, we&apos;re grateful for it. When
       you choose to invest in Canvas, we&apos;ll ensure you list Canvas as the
       second best investment you&apos;ve ever made for your practice,
       guaranteed. Contact us when you&apos;re ready to discuss the details.

      <h3>
        <span>1.</span> Making the Decision To Switch
      </h3>
      <p>
        You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined that
        we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return on investment. Our
        goal is to give you as much information as possible to make this determination one
        way or the other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application for
        you to get a feel for the platform as well as references to current customers to talk
        about their experience.

      <h3>
        <span>2.</span> Interfaces and Community Integration
      </h3>
      <p>
        Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and community
        resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax number, enrolling your
        payers with our clearinghouse, and getting bidirectional lab feeds running. We&apos;ll
        also load your preferred specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that
        sending referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health
        information exchanges or other information technology vendors are important, we
        will work with you to determine what we can deliver and when.

      <h3>
        <span>3. </span>Data Migration
      </h3>
      <p>
        The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your current data, which
        we have executed successfully with both remotely hosted and on-premise EMR
        databases. Then our work begins to import into Canvas. Patient demographics and
        information like medications, problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward.
        While importing clinical notes and documents is more challenging, our team has
        been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.

    <div class="container-second">
      <h3>
        <span>4. </span>Training and Site Visit
      </h3>
      <p>
        We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content,
        charge schedules, and much more. Role-based training will be done a few weeks
        prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team members with clinical, practice
        management, and billing workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our
        team can visit your practice to work side-by-side with you on implementation and
        training.

    <div class="container-second">
      <h3>
        <span>5. </span>Go-Live and Tuning
      </h3>
      <p>
        Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice. We will be
        with you, either in-person or remotely depending on your preference, to make sure
        everything goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you have a
        handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt; changing clinical microtemplates,
        setting us new automations, modifying practice management settings, and more.
        We are here to help with it all.

      <h3>
        <span>6. </span>Sustained Performance
      </h3>
      <p>
        All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises and provide
        support over the long term. Our Performance Warranty means that if we are not
        meeting expectations, you can terminate the agreement and receive all payments
        back. (We do not expect this to happen). For our Standard plans, we also offer a
        MIPS guarantee; if you receive a negative adjustment, we will cover it. And for
        everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect this to be a
        long, productive partnership for us both.
